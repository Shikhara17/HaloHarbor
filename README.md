# Personal Data Guardian

## Introduction
**Personal Data Guardian** is an innovative personal data management system designed to enhance data privacy and user control. This project leverages cutting-edge federated learning and secure computation technologies to provide robust protection and efficiency in handling personal information.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Data Privacy**: Employs federated learning to process data across decentralized devices without needing to exchange or expose personal information.
- **Secure Computation**: Integrates secure computation techniques to ensure that data processing is encrypted and secure across all phases.
- **User Control**: Gives users unprecedented control over their data, allowing them to decide how their information is used and shared.

## Tech Stack
- **Federated Learning Frameworks**: Utilizes popular federated learning libraries to manage data without centralizing it.
- **Secure Computation Tools**: Implements secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption to ensure data remains private during processing.
- **Data Management Software**: Incorporates advanced data management systems to handle user permissions and data storage efficiently.

## System Overview
Personal Data Guardian's architecture is built to ensure maximum security and efficiency:
- **Data Processing**: Data is processed locally on user devices, minimizing data leakage risks.
- **Encryption**: All data transmissions are encrypted using state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols.
- **Control Mechanisms**: Users have access to a dashboard where they can easily manage their data preferences and permissions.
